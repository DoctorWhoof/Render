# Render
Small rendering module for the Monkey programming language

Features:
- Perform all rendering in a "virtual resolution" that automatically resizes to the display device
- Optionally render to a texture, ideal for accurate "pixel art" games, with or without filtering
- Scaling can maintain aspect ratio (with black bars on edges of screen)
- Optional integer scaling for maximum fidelity pixel art, at the expense of not always filling the screen
- Drawing layers with parallax scrolling

Please check the render examples repository for common usage examples.
